Servlet API
------------------------
The javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http packages represent interfaces and classes for servlet api.
Interfaces in javax.servlet package
Servlet
ServletRequest
ServletResponse
RequestDispatcher
ServletConfig
ServletContext
SingleThreadModel
Filter
FilterConfig
FilterChain
ServletRequestListener
ServletRequestAttributeListener
ServletContextListener
ServletContextAttributeListener
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Classes in javax.servlet package
There are many classes in javax.servlet package. They are as follows:
GenericServlet
ServletInputStream
ServletOutputStream
ServletRequestWrapper
ServletResponseWrapper
ServletRequestEvent
ServletContextEvent
ServletRequestAttributeEvent
ServletContextAttributeEvent
ServletException

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are many interfaces in javax.servlet.http package. They are as follows:

HttpServletRequest
HttpServletResponse
HttpSession
HttpSessionListener
HttpSessionAttributeListener
HttpSessionBindingListener
HttpSessionActivationListener

Classes in javax.servlet.http package
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many classes in javax.servlet.http package. They are as follows:

HttpServlet
Cookie
HttpServletRequestWrapper
HttpServletResponseWrapper
HttpSessionEvent

SERVLET
-----------------
1)A servlet is a server side component.A servlet is a java programming language class used to extend the capabilities of servers that host application accessed via a request-response programming model.
2)servlet are durable object they remain in memory and specially instructed to be destroyed .servlet will be loaded on the address space of webserver.

What is servlet Container?
The servlet container is a part of webserver or application server that provide the network service over which request and response.A servlet container also contains and manages servlet through their life cycle.
A servlet container can also be built into a host web server and installed as an add-on component to webserver.

Types of servlets:-
------------------------
1)generic servlet are protocal independent.
2)Http servlet are protocal specific they can be invoke only with the http protocol.

when implementing a generic service we must extend GenericServlet class which provides the java servlet api.

when implementing a http service we must extends HttpServlet class which provides methods such as doGet and doPost.

two packages required to build servlet
1)javax.servlet
2)javax.servlet.http

Life cycle of servlet:-
----------------------------
1)init():-server invokes init() when servlet is first loaded into the webserver memory.This method is used to initialize new servlet instance.Return type is void.

2)getServletConfig():- Return type is servlet config.

3)service():-To activate the servlet instance to handle the client request.

4)getServletInfo():-Return String.

5)destroy():-It is called by the webserver to destroy the existing servlet instance,or clean up any resource the servlet is consuming.



What is servletContext?
Servlet context is a part of javax.servlet.*;
Servlet context is also called as application object.
Servlet context is used to obtain the information about environment on which servlet is running.
For every web-application the web-container needs the deployment descripter .if there is no error the web Container will create servletContext object for the application.There may be multiple servlet context object inside a web Container.

Servlet context is one per one web application .To communicate with servlet Conatiner we use ServletContext object.

Methods inside ServletContext interface are
1)String getInitParameter(String name)
2)void setAttribute(String name)
3)Object getAttribute()

In servlet application setAttribute() method is used to create java object.If any object previously present it overrides that object.
To get the object stored in the request object we use request.getAttribute();
Request.removeAttribute() is use to remove attribute from request Object.
HTTP Servlet:-
-----------------------
1)SendRedirect() :-we can redirect the browser to a resource part of the same application.
we can redirect another web application running through the same web container.
2)RequestDispatcher :-
it is an interface inside javax.servlet.*;
it contains two methods :-
1)forward(ServletRequest req,ServletResponse res)
2)include(ServletRequest req,ServletResponse res)
RequestDispatcher is to forward the request to other servlet or include the output of another servlet as a part of the response.
To build a web application to be stateful that can remember the state of the client we use 
1)hidden field 2)cookies 3)session object 4)url rewritting





Cookies :-
cookies is a small amount of information set by the server on the client machine.

It is useful for session tracking for each client request a cookies can provide client session id.

getSession(true) :-It creates a new session and set the value from request object.
getSession(false):-The web container search for the old session object.

servlets are multithreaded for each client request a separate thread will start.

Difference between GET and POST?
get and post are used to process the request of a client .get method is a part of url.so we can send less amount of data through get.the amount of information limited is 240-255 character.
But using post we can post larger amount of data through hidden field.
 
Session are more secure and fast because they are stored at server side.
Session has to be used internally with cookies or urlrewritting to maintain session id.


Servlet Filters:-
--------------------
1)init() :-calls the filter into service and sets the filter's configuration object.
2)doFilter():- performs the filtering task.
3)getFilterConfig():- Return the filter's configuration object.
4)destroy():-Removes a filter from service.

use of filter:-
---------------
1)securing application
2)help to safe guard the data.

Servlet Listener :-
--------------------------
It is a interface
There are 2 types :-
1)ServletContextListener
It is executed once the application is deployed in the application server.
2)HttpSessionListener
It is very useful in maintaining data available throughout the life cycle of web application until it is invalid or closed.
Uses:-
------
1)to keep the track of no of concurrent clients using a web application.
2)database need to be loaded on startup and saved while shut down.
